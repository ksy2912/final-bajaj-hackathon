LLM-Powered Intelligent Query‚ÄìRetrieval System
üöÄ Overview
This is an LLM-powered intelligent query‚Äìretrieval system designed for processing large documents and making contextual decisions in insurance, legal, HR, and compliance domains.

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
The system follows a 6-component architecture:

Input Documents - PDF Blob URL processing
LLM Parser - Extract structured queries
Embedding Search - FAISS/Pinecone retrieval (using Google Embeddings)
Clause Matching - Semantic similarity matching
Logic Evaluation - Decision processing
JSON Output - Structured response
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Backend: FastAPI
Vector DB: Google Embeddings (with cosine similarity)
LLM: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash
Document Processing: PDFMiner, PyPDF2
ML: scikit-learn, numpy, pandas
